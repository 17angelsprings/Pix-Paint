If you get the warning "'Pix Paint.app' cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer," you will need to temporarily override Gatekeeper.
This can be done in one of two ways: 

Method 1: 
1. Right-click (Control-click) on the app icon in the Finder window and select Open from the menu.
2. Click Open in the confirmation dialog.
3. Enter your password if prompted.

Method 2:
1. Open System Preferences.
2. Click Security & Privacy.
3. Then click General.
4. Cick Open Anyway.
